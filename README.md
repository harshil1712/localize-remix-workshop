# Localize Remix Workshop

Welcome to Localize Remix Workshop. In this repository, you will learn how to localize your Remix website.

This repository is divided into six steps, each with their own branch. Go through each step and follow the instructions mentioned in README.

## Overview

### [Step 1](https://github.com/harshil1712/localize-remix-workshop/tree/step-1)
In this step, you step up a new Remix project, add compoents, and render mock data.

### [Step 2](https://github.com/harshil1712/localize-remix-workshop/tree/step-2)
You start with the internationalization (i18n) process. You install required packages, and add configurations.

### [Step 3](https://github.com/harshil1712/localize-remix-workshop/tree/step-3)
Here, you add a language switcher that allows the user to easily switch the language. You also implement cookie for i18n.

### [Step 4](https://github.com/harshil1712/localize-remix-workshop/tree/step-4)
You fetch the content from Contentful using the GraphQL API, and render the content.

### [Step 5](https://github.com/harshil1712/localize-remix-workshop/tree/step-5)
In this step, you add dynamic routing. This allows the user to navigate to each recipe and get more details.

### [Step 6](https://github.com/harshil1712/localize-remix-workshop/tree/step-6)
In this final step, you update the language switcher to switch languages properly.
